Good job overall, just a few notes on your responses: <br>
For the data dictionary: The type of variable is more of whether it was "categorical" or "continous." Admit and Prestige are categorical -- "yes/no" and "1,2,3,4". While the GRE and GPA are continuous variables, a continuous series of numbers generally indicating some order of magnitude. <br>
Goals of exploratory analysis tends to be more focused on missing data, distributions of data, and figuring out how to handle missing/skewed data... would you need to delete it, amend it with some new calculated value, etc? <br>
