Q5: Another fairly easy way to check if you've dropped null values, is to just run a .count() function again, before and after. <br>
Q8: You can run df_raw.hist(), which would just plot all the histograms in one shot. Just more of an fyi to make life simpler. <br> 
Q10: When it comes to transforming data to handle skewness, you can try things like log transformation, or even squaring all values to see if there is a normalization that can take place. <br>
